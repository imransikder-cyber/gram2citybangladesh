# 🏡 Gram2City — Bangladesh Homestay Discovery (MVP SPA)

**Gram2City** is an early-stage MVP that helps travelers discover real homestays across Bangladesh — hill cottages, river huts, village mud homes, tea garden stays, heritage rooms, beach cottages, and more.

This project is built as a **Single Page Application (SPA)** using **HTML + Tailwind CSS + Vanilla JavaScript**, designed to run entirely on **GitHub Pages** with zero backend.
